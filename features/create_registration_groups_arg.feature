Feature: Create registration groups

As an Administrator, I want to create registration groups for a Course Offering

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a Schedule Coordinator

  Scenario: ARG 0.1: Successfully view and list default ao cluster and list aos
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
    Then the default activity offering cluster is present
    And all activity offerings are assigned to the ARG cluster

  Scenario: RG 2.1A: Successfully create a activity offering cluster (for a course offering with a single activity offering type) and assign activity offerings to the cluster
    Given I have created an additional activity offering cluster for a course offering
    And I move an activity offering to the cluster
    Then the activity offering is shown as part of the cluster
    #And the remaining activity offerings are shown as unassigned

  @bug @KSENROLL-4230
  Scenario: RG 2.1C: Error message is displayed if I attempt to create 2 activity offering clusters with the same private name
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I try to create a second activity offering cluster with the same private name
    Then a create cluster dialog error message appears stating "duplicate cluster name"
    And only one activity offering cluster is created

  Scenario: Validate Registration group numbers
    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types
    When I create an activity offering cluster
    And I add all activity offerings to the activity offering cluster
    And I generate registration groups
    And the correct number of registration groups are created

#  Scenario: RG 2.1B/2.4B: Successfully create a default activity offering cluster and reg groups with all activity offerings assigned to the cluster
#    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering
#    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster

#    And registration groups are not generated
#
#  Scenario: RG 2.2B - Cannot generate default (unconstrained) AOC unless there is at least one AO for each AO Type specified by the FO

#    When I generate registration groups with no activity offering cluster
#    Then a registration groups error message appears stating "unassigned activity offering list must contain at least one activity from each of those associated with this Format"
#    And no activity offering cluster is created
#
#  Scenario: RG 2.3A: Generate registration groups where the max enrolment is not equal for activity types within the constrained activity offering cluster
#    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with 2 activity types
#    When I create an activity offering cluster
#    And I assign two activity offerings of different types and different max enrolment
#    And I generate registration groups
#    Then a cluster warning message appears stating "The sums of maximum enrollment seats for each activity offering type are not equal"
#    And a registration group is generated
#
#  Scenario: RG 2.3B - Generate registration groups where the max enrolment is not equal for activity types within the DEFAULT activity offering cluster
#    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where the total max enrolment for each type is not equal

#
#  Scenario: RG 2.4C: Generate registration groups for several constrained activity offering clusters with assigned activity offerings with scheduling conflicts
#    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where there are activity offering scheduling conflicts
#    When I create 2 activity offering clusters
#    And I assign two activity offerings to each cluster with scheduling conflicts
#    And I generate registration groups
#    Then a cluster warning message appears stating "invalid due to scheduling conflicts"
#    And registration groups are generated
#    And registration groups with time conflicts are marked as invalid
#
#  Scenario: RG 2.4D: Generate Reg Groups for default AO Cluster where there are scheduling time conflicts
#    Given I manage registration groups for a course offering with multiple activity types where there are activity offering scheduling conflicts

#    And a cluster warning message appears stating "invalid due to scheduling conflicts"
#    And registration groups with time conflicts are marked as invalid
#
#  Scenario: RG 3.1A: assign one or more AOs to an existing constrained AOC and update the Reg Groups for this FO
#    Given I have generated a registration group for a course offering with lecture and quiz activity types leaving some activity offerings unassigned
#    When I assign a quiz activity offering to the existing activity offering cluster

#    And I assign the new activity offerings to the default activity offering cluster
#    Then a cluster status message appears stating "Only Some Registration Groups Generated"

##suspend AO functionality in M6?
##  Scenario: Generate registration groups - suspended or cancelled activity offerings are excluded
##    I am logged in as a Schedule Coordinator
##    And I manage course offerings for a course offering with a single actvitiy #use ENGL103A (delete if exists, then copy ENGL103)
##    When I set an activity offering status to cancelled
##    And I generate unconstrained registration groups
##    Then registration groups are not generated for the activity offering in cancelled status
#
##suspend CO functionality?
## Scenario: Generate registration groups - cannot be generated for course offering in '???' status (can be generated in Draft,Planned,Offered,Open)
##    I am logged in as a Schedule Coordinator
##    And I manage registration groups for a course offering with a single actvitiy #use ENGL103A (delete if exists, then copy ENGL103)
##    When I set an course offering to '???' #how change course offering status
##    And I generate unconstrained registration groups
##    Then registration groups are not generated for the course offering in '???' status
