Content removed as part of subversion to git conversion.  MPX files are stored in the data base maven artifacts (for releases) aswell as in the original git conversion of the repository which due to its size is not hosted on the public github site.  For more information look at the Impex section of the developer guide: https://wiki.kuali.org/display/STUDENTDOC/Kuali+Student+Developer+Guide (currently section 3.2)
